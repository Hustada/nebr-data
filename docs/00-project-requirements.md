## 1. üéØ Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the functionality of the [DataRepublican Expos√© Graph](https://datarepublican.com/expose/) using Nebraska-specific nonprofit data. The goal is to visualize the flow of funds ‚Äî particularly taxpayer-sourced contributions ‚Äî between entities such as political committees, nonprofits, and government-connected organizations. The final product will be interactive, web-based, and optimized for both government insiders and public transparency.

## 2. üéØ Objectives

- Visualize financial relationships between Nebraska-based organizations.  
- Highlight flows of taxpayer money (government contributions).  
- Enable searching, filtering, and browsing of graph data interactively.  
- Make data transparent and useful for politicians, watchdog groups, and eventually the general public.  
- Provide exportable graph summaries and downloadable subgraphs.

## 6. üîé Data Processing Logic

### 6.1 General Node & Edge Extraction
- Each **organization** becomes a node.  
- Each **contribution** or **expenditure** becomes a directed edge (source ‚Üí target).  
- Use `ORG_###` and `SRC_###` as node keys (already implemented).

### 6.2 Taxpayer Fund Calculation (`govt_amt`)
- Apply keyword matching to contribution sources to identify likely government contributors.  
- Keywords: `"STATE"`, `"DEPARTMENT"`, `"GOVERNMENT"`, `"FEDERAL"`, `"COUNTY"`, etc.  
- Output a `govt_amt_by_org.json` with:
  ```json
  {
    "7582": 19420.23,
    "7669": 12056.50,
    ...
  }
